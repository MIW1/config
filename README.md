# What's this?
A collection of settings and utils with installscript to easily configure a new machine to my liking.


# Usage
install.py documentation goes here.

```
install.py install
```

## Repo structure

configs-and-scripts-to-install - Contains all config files and utility scripts to be linked, or copied.
dummy-install-folder-for-testing-purposes - Test-flag makes things get installed here. For development, debugging etc.
machine-specific-files - Things that are volatile and wont be checked in. Downloaded files, git repos, settings files that are generated by install script, machine/environment local scripts/aliases etc.


TODO Make a section with things that are easier to write down than install.
E.g. packages I commonly install, settings for programs which are difficult to auto configure etc.


# Gnome termial
No good way to store profiles for gnome terminal.
Settings-tools used may differ between versions, safer and easier to reconstruct than attempting to script.
